The time is ripe. Strike and obliterate the enemy
bases totally. It has had time to install some
additional defences, however, so take care.

We have developed a new technology which should be
of some assistance. We call it the warp core.
Two have been installed - one to take you to each
enemy base. Take care in their use as you will
emerge in highly hostile territory.

Go for it, commander!
