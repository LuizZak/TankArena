Your troops have been fighting for months to
recover a captured area. The enemy is getting
weaker and weaker but rumours are that the enemy
has developed a radical new weapon. The new
weapon will be supplied tonight.

To cover up the operation the enemy is launching
an attack to your base.

Intelligence has reported that the convoy is
moving from the north-west to the south-east.

Stop the attack to your base and prevent the
convoy from reaching it's destination. Destroy
most of the convoy support tanks also.

If you succeed this one the enemy will certainly
be too weak to win and the war will be over!
