You've been briefed. You need to destroy
critical military targets and land on
the aircraft carrier. Now you are on the
runway loaded with everything you need.
A wingman and an LRM-1 (Little Runt
Model 1, the newest minaturized tank)
have been assigned to protect you. But
then...

You notice enemy aircraft on the radar.
A missile hits a fuel tank. Your run-
way starts exploding. You have to jet-
tison your heavy equipment so you can
take off quickly. A nuke vaporizes
your base. 

You know that you can't destroy the
critical targets with just 5 missiles.
But you know that an LRM-1 is station-
ed next to the aircraft carrier. You
have to get there.
