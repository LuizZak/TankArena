On the way to the aircraft carrier,
your radar spots a turret. You ready
a missile and fire it just as the
turret comes into view. It never has
a chance to shoot.

You land on the aircraft carrier, get
out, and start running toward the LRM-1.

You talk to the computer (it is much too
small for a human to be in it) and tell
it your problem.

The LR speeds away and you walk back to
your jet. You hear machine-gun fire and
buildings exploding. A jet flies over-
head and your wingman toasts it with
missiles.

You check on the LR and find that it is
toasting buildings at an incredibly high
rate. When the last building vanishes in
smoke and flame, you radio it to come
back to the aircraft carrier.

Five minutes later, the small drone speeds
across the water, and stops next to your
plane.
