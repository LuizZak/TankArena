You've been discovered! The enemy is planning
an attack!

Intelligence has informed us that there are two
crucial convoys passing here today - a train to
the south and a van to the northeast. Both
contain material that could be vital in the
enemy's attempt to construct a base to the west.
Destroy them both immediately, before the train
can reach the safety of the mountain pass and the
van arrive at the enemy base. Good luck.

One final note - be careful with your ammunition
as we are currently awaiting an overdue supply
convoy. Weapons are a little on the scarce side
but should suffice nonetheless.
