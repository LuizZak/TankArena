Recently after a nuclear bomb hit the Los
Alamos test site, you've been assigned to
a small island in Frech Polynesia. The bomb
seemed to have came from that island.

You've been given a Hovertank (Destroyer)
loaded with weapons. Your mission is to
get on the island by bridge (the bridge will
be dynamited when you're there), escape the
local defenses and place a remote controlled
bomb on the nuclear weapons to detonate them.

You must go by tunnel into the base, place the
time bombs, then get out by the small opening
and detonate the bombs.

- Warning -
The only defense of this island is an LRM-1.
It has been refitted to fire mortars.
Destroy this fast if you want to survive.
