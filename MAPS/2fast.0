Capture The Flag
----------------

The idea with this map is that Player 2 has a
very fast tank, but with almost no firepower.
Player 1 has all the firepower, but is very
slow. The powerful tank has to defend the
flag, and the weak tank has to race around
and try to steal it.

Hint : Player 2 can use the teleport in a
critical situation.

Recommended Playing :

PLAYER 1 : Everything but the mouse.
PLAYER 2 : Mouse.
