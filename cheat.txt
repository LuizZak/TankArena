All cheats are activated from the DOS command line, so here
are all supported command line options.

First the boring ones:
----------------------

-SETUP			Enter setup menu.
-SETSOUND		Enter the setup sound menu.
-KEYTEST		Test keyboard.
-INFO			Displays info.
-DEBUG			Display framerate etc.

Now the interesting ones:
-------------------------

-AUTOLOCK		Automatically locks maps when saving.
			Also enables loading of locked maps!
-NOLOCKLIMIT		Gives you infinite range when locking
			your homing missiles, handy for looking
			at a map!
-GOD			Oh well, guess what this is!
-NOFAIL			Game stops detecting if you failed your
			mission.
-LOADSOFWEAPONS		Infinite ammo!
-CODES			Displays mission codes of all maps!

So if you want to have fun you start tank like this:

C:\TANK>tank -nolocklimit -god -loadsofweapons

There is another interesting bit in this file:
----------------------------------------------

If you think a resolution of 640x480 is too low, then edit the file
"TANK.CFG".

Use for example:

GRAPH_DRV = 0
RES_X = 1024
RES_Y = 768
NUM_PAGES = 1

It is safe to use GRAPH_DRV = 0, Tank Arena will then autodetect the
graph driver. NUM_PAGES is the number of video pages the game will
use (1 or 2). The video memory required for a specific setting 
is: NUM_PAGES * RES_X * RES_Y. Make sure this doesn't exceed the 
memory on your video card.

If you changed something and you can't get it right again, delete
TANK.CFG.

Have fun!
